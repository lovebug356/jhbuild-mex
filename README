MediaExplorer - JHBuild
===============================================================================

jhbuid-mex is a repository containing scripts and a JHBuild moduleset for
building and developing the MediaExplorer User Shell and related libraries.

Initialization
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install the following dependencies (on Debian) :

  bison flex libdbus-glib-1-dev libgdu-dev libgudev-1.0-dev libicu-dev

You should check out JHBuild from the GNOME Git repository:

  git clone git://git.gnome.org/jhbuild

Then build it and install it.

Then, from within your jhbuild-mex clone run:

  make install

This command will install:

  - $HOME/bin/jhbuild-mex       - a wrapper around jhbuild
  - $HOME/.jhbuildrc-mex        - a jhbuild configuration file
  - $HOME/.jhbuildrc-mex-custom - a jhbuild configuration file for
                                  customisations of the default settings

Building MediaExplorer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build the whole MediaExplorer UI:

  jhbuild-mex build

This will also take care of the dependencies.

The modules will be downloaded under $HOME/mex/source.
The modules will be installed under $HOME/mex/install

Running MediaExplorer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run MediaExplorer:

  cd $HOME/mex/install/bin

Start a jhbuild shell:

  jhbuild-mex shell

Start Tracker (the version installed by jhbuild):

  ./tracker-control -s

Then start MediaExplorer:

  ./media-explorer

Common issues
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Why jhbuild can't find the MediaExplorer modules file?
A: The default modules file is expected to be at:

  ~/src/jhbuild-mex/build/mex.modules

If you've installed jhbuild-mex to a different location,
edit the jhbuildrc-mex-custom configuration file, uncommenting and
editing the

  moduleset

line. Using the absolute path to the mex.modules file should work.

Q: Why doesn't <insert a D-Bus service> start?
A: In order to activate a D-Bus service installed within the JHBuild
root you have to modify the /etc/dbus-1/session.conf file by adding
the following line:

  <servicedir>@PREFIX@/mex/install/share/dbus-1/services</servicedir>

Where @PREFIX@ is the prefix used by JHBuild -- the user's home directory
by default.

You will have to restart D-Bus, which usually means logging out or a
complete reboot.
